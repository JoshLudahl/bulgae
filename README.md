# Bulgae
Bulgae is Latin for budget, money, purse, wallet, etc. We will focus on the meaning of budget for this application. The idea here is to create an online budgeting application which is easy to use, simple, and enormously powerful. Budgets tell a lot about how we spend our money, how we allocate our spending can shed some light on our habbits. The aim here is to enlighten you and show you where you could improve your spending habbits.

The project will be MEVN based SPA with an easy to use interface.
